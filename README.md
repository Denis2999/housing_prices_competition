# Housing Prices Competition - Kaggle

This repository contains the code and analysis for the Kaggle "Housing Prices Competition". The objective of the project is to predict the prices of houses based on various features of the houses.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the training and test datasets.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
- **`models/`**: Saved machine learning models.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/Denis2999/housing_prices_competition.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the datasets from Kaggle and place them in the `data/` folder:
- [Kaggle Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

4. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore the data and train the models.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from the raw dataset to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating models based on RMSE and other metrics.

## Results

Final model performance and predictions can be found in the `results/` directory. The best performing model is uploaded to Kaggle for the final evaluation.
